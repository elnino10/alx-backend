## Pagination
RESTful web APIs are important in the data-driven world of today in moving information from a web server to client(s). However, it is sometimes inefficient and resource-intensive to retrieve all the data at once when working with huge datasets.

A web API can retrieve data more efficiently by paginating it so that the dataset is divided into smaller chunks of data. This project showcases pagination of a web API.

## Project Objective
- How to paginate a dataset with simple page and page_size parameters
- How to paginate a dataset with hypermedia metadata `(HATEOAS)`
- How to paginate in a deletion-resilient manner
